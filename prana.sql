It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2984" alt="responsive" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255" data-recalc-dims="1" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2954" alt="colors" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2967" alt="themes" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344" data-recalc-dims="1" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789" alt="The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">on the make/core blog</a>.

He referenced Pooria Asteraky&#8217;s <a href="http://pooriast.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/trackers-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">discovery</a> that a social sharing plugin had applied 13 trackers on a vanilla installation. This is no surprise, really, as a site owner installs social sharing plugins with the express purpose of sending information out from the website via Javascript or some other means.</p>\n<p>Otto left a <a href="http://pooriast.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/trackers-wordpress-plugin/comment-page-1/#comment-1384" target="_blank">comment</a> on the original post, clarifying which trackers might indeed be harmful or unwanted. He said, <span class="pullquote alignleft">&#8220;Our primary concern in this regard would be plugins that do things without the consent or without the knowledge of the website owner.&#8221;</span> This is an important distinction to make, as many trackers perform a welcome and valuable service, such as Jetpack stats, Gravatar or Google Analytics. The trackers you want to hunt down are those that collect information about users or activities on the site without consent.<span id="more-13386"></span></p>\n<h3>Let&#8217;s hunt trackers!</h3>\n<p>Since plugin authors may not always be transparent about what kinds of trackers their plugins install, especially if they&#8217;re not hosted on WordPress.org, site owners need some way to sniff these out. That&#8217;s where a free tool like <a href="http://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">Ghostery</a> comes in handy for finding out what services might be communicating to and from a website. It operates as a browser extension and there are versions available for Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE, iOS and Firefox for Android.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what it looks like when I installed it to Chrome, which was painless and instant.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ghostery-chrome.png" rel="prettyphoto[13386]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ghostery-chrome.png?resize=453%2C202" alt="ghostery-chrome" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13499" /></a></p>\n<p>Once installed, the extension looks for third-party page elements (or &#8220;trackers&#8221;) on the web pages you visit and displays them in the corner of your browser. It verifies these trackers against Ghostery&#8217;s extensive library of more than  1,700 trackers and 3,400 tracking patterns, including beacons, advertisements, analytics services, page widgets, and other third-party page elements.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ghostery-in-action.png" rel="prettyphoto[13386]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ghostery-in-action.png?resize=594%2C193" alt="ghostery-in-action" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13501" /></a></p>\n<h3>Get the Details Behind the Trackers</h3>\n<p>If you suspect that a plugin might be &#8220;phoning home&#8221; from your website, inserting ads or invisible pixels for tracking, Ghostery gives you a quick way to track down the tracker and find out who is behind it. It&#8217;s not just for use on your own website &#8211; you can check out other sites as well. Here&#8217;s a quick example run on a WordPress.org plugin page:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trackers1.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13386]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trackers1.jpg?resize=682%2C499" alt="trackers" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13557" /></a></p>\n<p>You can click on each individual tracker to see the URL and find out more information. For the most part, you&#8217;ll see a harmless list like the one above. The Ghostery tool comes in handy if you feel that you may have been hacked or have noticed some suspicious activity on your site. The information Ghostery provides will help you to investigate your plugins and/or themes to find the culprit. It&#8217;s also useful for inspecting other sites for a small window into their third-party connections.</p>\n<h3>Block Unwanted Trackers</h3>\n<p>Ghostery also lets visitors block trackers based on the type of function they perform or on an individual basis.

Post Customizer works in a similar fashion to the theme customizer. When a user previews a page or a post, an interface is loaded that looks just like the theme customizer. From this interface, you can edit the post excerpt, post thumbnail, save changes to the post or close the interface without saving. Selecting text within the post displays a simple editor that makes it easy to style words, apply unordered lists etc.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13538" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PostCustomizer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13533]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-large wp-image-13538" alt="Customizing a post" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PostCustomizer.jpg?resize=500%2C166" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Simple editor to edit posts</p></div>\n<h3>Idea Turned Into Reality</h3>\n<p>I got in touch with John James Jacoby, one of several developers for the plugin (along with Carl Danley, John Bloch, Taylor Lovett, and Drew Jaynes). I found out why the plugin was created, the decision to use the customizer interface and whether or not this is just a prototype or something they want people to use on a routine basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Tavern</strong> &#8211; <em>Is this plugin a prototype of an idea to edit posts or does 10up plan on improving the plugin? Does 10up want people to use it?</em></p>\n<p><strong>JJJ</strong> &#8211; Both! It was an idea I&#8217;ve had in my head for a while, and we threw it together at our company meetup and then it sat mostly unloved for a few months. We spent a few hours getting it to a workable state, and open sourced it for improvements and feedback. We actually built the majority of it over the course of two evenings, just hacking together and rapidly prototyping.</p>\n<p><strong>Tavern</strong> &#8211; <em>When it comes to the post customizer, does it not make sense to be able to have the category and tags be editable from within the customizer? At that point, you&#8217;re sort of substituting the post writing screen although you don&#8217;t see the customizing interface until after you hit preview.</em></p>\n<p><strong>JJJ</strong> &#8211; Sure. Pretty much any metabox is game for inclusion. We specifically wanted to provide an interface for editing post content after the original post was written. We’d like to work <strong>Revisions</strong> into the sidebar, so authors can scroll through updates live.</p>\n<h3>Nice Idea But Needs A Lot Of Elbow Grease</h3>\n<p>While the idea is great, the implementation and experience needs to be improved before users can feel comfortable with using this plugin. Here are some things I noticed.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Or Save</strong> &#8211; The theme customizer that the interface is based on does not feel natural when editing posts. When editing themes, I realize an update will save the changes I made to the theme. For posts however, I&#8217;m used to clicking a save button. While the update button does the same thing, it just doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>\n<p><strong>Exiting The Interface</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m used to closing interfaces with an X on the top right portion of the screen. Despite the post customizer using a familiar layout, I keep looking to the right of the screen for a way to close the editing panel. It&#8217;s as simple as clicking the close button but I&#8217;m always looking somewhere else to get out of the editing interface.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PostCustomizerExiting.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13533]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13542" alt="Exiting The Post Customizer" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PostCustomizerExiting.jpg?resize=500%2C189" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also weird that upon closing the editing panel, I&#8217;m taken back to the WordPress editing screen that&#8217;s missing the right sidebar. It&#8217;s here that I have to click an X to completely close the editing interface. Clicking close and then the X feels redundant. I&#8217;d rather see the close button take the role of doing both tasks and returning me to the normal editing panel without any additional steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Editor Toolbar Sticks To The Top Of The Post</strong> &#8211; When the editing toolbar is enabled, it sticks to the top of the page. While I could use keyboard shortcuts, I&#8217;d rather see the editor appear above the text I&#8217;m highlighting so I don&#8217;t have to scroll or move my mouse so much. When the edited text is not highlighted, the toolbar should disappear.</p>\n<p><strong>Excerpts Reload The Entire Page</strong> &#8211; The first time you try to edit the excerpt in the sidebar, it reloads the entire page along with the interface. I found this to be a jarring experience and would like to see the excerpt loaded without having to reload the entire page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PostCustomizerExcerpts.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13533]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13541" alt="PostCustomizer Excerpts" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PostCustomizerExcerpts.jpg?resize=297%2C305" /></a></p>\n<h3>Interesting Take On The Post Editing Idea</h3>\n<p>I never would have thought that the theme customizer interface could be used to edit posts. Post Customizer proves the idea has merit. It will be interesting to see how this plugin evolves over time. If you&#8217;re interested in contributing back to the plugin, you can <a title="https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer" href="https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer">fork it on

There were 188 contributors that helped make WordPress 3.8 a reality. I&#8217;m proud to say that <a title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/jeffr0" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/jeffr0">I</a> was among those 188 contributors. I never thought I&#8217;d be able to make the list but thanks to some help, I was able to contribute in my own way. The following is my experience contributing to WordPress. <span id="more-13159"></span></p>\n<p>During the development of WordPress 3.8, I used the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Testing</a> plugin to keep up with changes on my local server. While testing the default theme TwentyFourteen, I noticed a typo within the theme details. I could have reported the typo to a default theme team member and it would have been fixed immediately. However, once I discovered the typo I knew it was an opportunity to contribute to the core and make it on the contributors list.</p>\n<h3>Is Fixing A Typo Really A Contribution?</h3>\n<p>Before I reported the typo, I thought about whether fixing a typo would classify as a contribution. It was a small change that involved adding one letter to a word. I asked my followers on Twitter what they thought.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Curiosity question. If I fix a typo in WordPress core, is that enough to get a credit link for a contribution or is that not enough?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jeff (@jeffr0) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffr0/statuses/410575551905030144">December 11, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>What I learned is that some people have contributed to WordPress simply by removing white space from code. Konstantin Obenland contributed to WordPress by adding an underscore where it was appropriate. The moral of the story is that no matter how small the contribution, every little bit counts and helps to improve the software. There is no need to feel guilty or unworthy of being listed as a contributor if all you did was fix a typo.</p>\n<h3>Getting My Patch Into Core</h3>\n<p>After discovering the typo, I immediately reached out to Konstantin Obenland who was a member of the team responsible for TwentyFourteen. I reported the typo to him and he recommended that I create a new ticket on <a title="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a>. Bug reports along with their associated patches go through Trac in the form of tickets. Trac is not for the faint of heart. It&#8217;s an intimidating website for those that don&#8217;t frequent it often. Even though I&#8217;ve participated in the WordPress community for years, Trac still rattles my nerves when I create a ticket.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ContributionTicketFor38.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13159]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ContributionTicketFor38.jpg?resize=500%2C205" alt="The Ticket I Created For WordPress 3.8" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13496" /></a></p>\n<p>Using Konstantin as a mentor, he walked me through the process of <a title="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26528" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26528">creating the ticket</a>. He also created the diff file for me that I uploaded as a patch. I didn&#8217;t know how to create diff files so it was nice of Konstantin to create one for me. Once the patch was uploaded, the ticket was out of my hands. After some edits to the ticket, the right people saw the patch and applied the fix to WordPress 3.8 before it was released.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Needs Core Contributor Mentors</h3>\n<p>WordPress would benefit from having a list of people that act as mentors for those contributing to WordPress for the first time via Trac. Drupal has gone through great lengths to make core contributing mentorship a priority. They have <a title="http://drupalmentoring.org/" href="http://drupalmentoring.org/">an entire site</a> dedicated to mentoring new contributors. Even if it were not as organized as Drupal, I&#8217;d like to see a list of mentors I could get in touch with to walk me through the process of patching a bug or fixing a typo in core.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, WordPress tried to create a core mentorship program but it didn&#8217;t take off. The contributor team was much smaller than it is today and WordPress didn&#8217;t have regular working teams. I asked Jen Mylo if there are any plans to try and create a mentorship program now that there are a lot more people involved with the core development of WordPress. She tells me that she is currently working on a proposal for a formalized mentorship program across all of the contributor teams. </p>\n<blockquote><p>We didn&#8217;t really have regular working teams then, and even the core team back then was much smaller active group. We&#8217;re in a much better place now to support formal mentorship programs since we now have regularly meeting teams, team reps posting weekly updates, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jen says the proposal will be posted sometime before the end of the year.</p>\n<h3>Contributing Was Awesome</h3>\n<p>Despite it only being a typo, contributing to the core of WordPress was exhilarating. For a brief moment, I felt like learning PHP and MySQL to contribute everything I could to WordPress. After the excitement went away, I came back to my senses. Special thanks to Konstantin Obenland for holding my hand during the process of contributing. The last thing I want to do on Trac is make the core WordPress developers job harder by improperly filing tickets. Instead of screwing up, it&#8217;s better to not mess with Trac at all. At least that&#8217;s the way I&#8217;ve approached it.</p>\n<p>While there is a <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/">handbook devoted entirely to contributing to WordPress</a>, it&#8217;s not the same as being guided through the process with an experienced individual. Thankfully, most of the <a title="http://chrislema.com/approachable-wordpress/" href="http://chrislema.com/approachable-wordpress/">WordPress community is approachable</a> and getting help is as easy as tweeting, skypeing, or emailing someone.</p>\n<p><strong>At the end of the day, I contributed to WordPress and you can too.</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 23:30:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: Piwik Redesigned: Open Source Web Analytics Software Gets a Fresh Look";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13440";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wptavern.com/piwik-redesigned-open-source-web-analytics-software-gets-a-fresh-look";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5687:"<p><a href="http://piwik.org/" target="_blank">Piwik</a> is leading the way when it comes to open source web analytics software. More than 1,000,000 websites are using Piwik for analytics, according to the current <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Piwik-Web-Analytics" target="_blank">Builtwith assessment</a>. The team has just launched its 2.0 release with a brand new website and redesigned mobile app. This release is the culmination of seven months of work from the Piwik team and community.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/piwik_app.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13440]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/piwik_app.jpg?resize=1025%2C613" alt="piwik_app" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13464" /></a></p>\n<p>Haven&#8217;t heard of Piwik? That&#8217;s probably due to the fact that Google Analytics thoroughly dominates this space. But there&#8217;s something exceptional that sets Piwik apart from Google Analytics. <strong>Piwik is free and open source, affording you privacy and full control over your data.</strong> Piwik takes about five minutes to install on your server. You can track multiple websites and keep all your data in the same place on your own server, away from prying eyes. </p>\n<h3>Piwik: An Open Source Alternative to Google Analytics</h3>\n<p>The Piwik dashboard has everything you&#8217;d expect from a comprehensive web analytics platform, including recent visits, keyword information, visitor location map, browser information, referrer information, and real-time visitor stats, and more available via widgets.</p>\n<p>I had the chance to chat with Piwik founder and lead developer Matthieu Aubry. Given that Google Analytics is considered the default choice for the vast majority of websites, I asked him what is the number one reason people choose Piwik over its more popular competitor. He replied, &#8220;There are many reasons but <span class="pullquote alignleft">I think the number one reason for many choosing Piwik over Google Analytics is privacy and keeping control over sensitive user data.</span> This is becoming all too important. Another good reason may be that people like the simplicity of the UI and the openness of the platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Part of that openness is that developers are encouraged to extend the platform using the Piwik APIs and many are already doing some creative things.<strong> &#8220;There are several businesses using the API to provide web analytics to many of their customers&#8217; websites automatically (by creating website users and scheduled reports using the API),&#8221;</strong> Aubry said. &#8220;Others use the API to request data and display it elsewhere. The tracking API is also used to implement custom app usage tracking within Mobile apps. Finally, what we hope to help developers build 3rd party plugins similar to WordPress or other popular open source frameworks. This will be our chance to bring a lot of innovation in analytics!&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How to Use Piwik With WordPress</h3>\n<p>Piwik is <a href="http://piwik.org/faq/new-to-piwik/#faq_45" target="_blank">licensed under the GPL</a>, just like WordPress. The WP-Piwik plugin integrates Piwik into your WordPress site, adds the tracking code and displays a summary of stats in your admin panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/piwik_wp.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13440]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/piwik_wp.jpg?resize=1024%2C596" alt="piwik_wp" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13478" /></a></p>\n<p>Instructions for setting up WP-Piwik can be found on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-piwik/" target="_blank">WordPress Integration</a> page and the the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-piwik/" target="_blank">plugin</a> is available in the WordPress repository. </p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s New in Piwik 2.0?</h3>\n<p>In addition to the new website, Piwik users will enjoy a host of new features with this <a href="http://piwik.org/changelog/piwik-2-0/" target="_blank">2.0 release</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch of the Piwik <a href="http://plugins.piwik.org/" target="_blank">marketplace</a> for plugins and themes</li>\n<li>Browse and install plugins and themes directly from within Piwik</li>\n<li>New completely redesigned mobile app, allowing users to monitor web traffic on the go</li>\n<li>Piwik 2.0 has now been translated by volunteers into 53 different languages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team has also launched a new <a href="http://piwik.pro/" target="_blank">Piwik Pro</a> service that will offer professional analytics services for businesses, NGOs and governments, as well as cloud hosting and enterprise deployments. The service also includes custom integrations and support. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about Piwik but would rather try it before installing on your own server, check out the <a href="http://demo.piwik.org/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=7&period=day&date=yesterday#module=Dashboard&action=embeddedIndex&idSite=7&period=day&date=yesterday&idDashboard=1" target="_blank">live demo</a>. Piwik is not just for web analytics &#8211; you can also use it to track e-commerce, server logs and intranet analytics.</p>\n<p>Many website owners are willing to trade privacy for the convenience of Google Analytics. But if you&#8217;re serious about owning your own data and protecting sensitive information, it&#8217;s nice to know that there are open source options like <a href="http://piwik.org/" target="_blank">Piwik</a> that can provide the same comprehensive level of analytics.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 20:53:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: WPTavern Gets Responsive With New Design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13443";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://wptavern.com/wptavern-gets-responsive-with-new-design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2549:"<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since the Tavern has received a new coat of paint.

Everyone needs more time in the day. For those who have families, it can be particularly tough to fit in a full-time job, time with the kids and contributions to open source projects. Giving someone the gift of time is nearly impossible, but there are ways to approximate it. Offer to babysit, make a meal, perform some car maintenance or time-consuming chores. Efforts to help your friend or family member free up time could be far more meaningful than any gift you could buy. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 00:02:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WPTavern: Jetpack is Now Available on Github";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13357";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-now-available-on-github";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3632:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/jetpack.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13357]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/jetpack.jpg?resize=800%2C259" alt="jetpack" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13381" /></a><br />\nThe <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a> plugin code is now available on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack" target="_blank">github</a> and the team <a href="https://twitter.com/Viper007Bond/status/412731744962359296" target="_blank">welcomes</a> your pull requests. With the addition of Jetpack, Automattic now has <a href="https://github.com/Automattic" target="_blank">106 public repositories</a> on github. That&#8217;s a lot of shared code! </p>\n<p>Jetpack has been downloaded nearly eight million times since its debut on WordPress.org. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed using Jetpack and have some ideas for improving it, github is a great way to contribute back to the plugin. Your code will improve the Jetpack experience on millions of websites. There are also other ways to contribute without writing any code:<span id="more-13357"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://jetpack.me/contact-support/" target="_blank">Join</a> the Jetpack Beta Test group</li>\n<li>Lend a hand answering questions in the Jetpack <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack" target="_blank">support forum</a></li>\n<li>Report bugs, with reproduction steps, or post patches on Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=jetpack" target="_blank">trac</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learn the Basics of Contributing to Open Source Software with Jetpack</h3>\n<p>Jetpack probably has one of the most organized <a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/" target="_blank">guides to contribution</a> that I have ever seen for an open source plugin project. The team has created contribution opportunities for users and developers at all levels. The guide outlines ways to <a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/#contribute" target="_blank">contribute at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels</a>. </p>\n<p>What really stands out about the Jetpack contribution guide is that it actually teaches you the basics of contributing to an open source project, including topics such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/#source" target="_blank">How to check out the source code</a> &#8211; Learn how to install and navigate subversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/#bugs" target="_blank">How to create a great bug report</a> &#8211; Learn the anatomy of a Trac ticket and how to submit tickets</li>\n<li><a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/#patch" target="_blank">How to write and submit a patch</a> &#8211; Get step-by-step instructions for submitting a patch</li>\n<li><a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/#practices" target="_blank">Best practices for WordPress development</a> &#8211; Get more information on PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding standards</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it. Nobody springs from the womb understanding how to create a good bug report or submit a patch. That&#8217;s why guides like this are so important. Getting involved on a smaller project like Jetpack is an opportunity to test your wings in an area where you have an interest. If you have an open source project where you want to attract more contributors, consider creating a detailed, organized guide in the same way Jetpack has outlined contribution opportunities. That little extra effort in documentation might open up the floodgates to contributions. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 19:49:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Authors: Be Up Front and Honest With Users About Tracking";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13276";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-authors-be-up-front-and-honest-with-users-about-tracking";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5656:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/TrackerTransparency.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13276]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13356" alt="Tracker Transparency" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/TrackerTransparency.jpg?resize=148%2C93" /></a>Plugins collecting information and phoning home to a third-party without the user’s consent is a serious issue in the WordPress community. The <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">WordPress plugin repository guidelines</a> are clear on this matter specifically, <strong>point number seven</strong> and its sub points. Pooria Asteraky has <a title="http://pooriast.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/trackers-wordpress-plugin/" href="http://pooriast.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/trackers-wordpress-plugin/">published a post</a> that explains why there needs to be more transparency across the WordPress community as a whole as it relates to &#8216;<em>trackers</em>&#8216; being installed on users sites via WordPress plugins. <span id="more-13276"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ghosterylogo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13276]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13367" alt="Ghosterylogo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ghosterylogo.jpg?resize=219%2C75" /></a>According to Pooria, trackers are referred to as tracking codes that collect information such as statistics. After installing a WordPress plugin that provided social sharing buttons, he discovered through the use of <a title="http://www.ghostery.com/" href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, that there were thirteen trackers installed on the website. Five of which had nothing to do with social networks. The rest of the post goes on to explain why this is not a good thing for the WordPress community and calls on webmasters, plugin authors, and everyone else on the web to be completely transparent regarding the trackers that are being used on their sites.</p>\n<h3>The Community Does A Good Job Policing Itself</h3>\n<p>WordPress is open source and so are all of the plugins hosted within the plugin repository. While there are plugin reviewers that voluntarily do their best to make sure nothing malicious ends up in the repository, some plugins slip through the cracks. However, because of the size of the WordPress userbase and how easy it is to look at the plugin&#8217;s code, those plugins usually don&#8217;t last long in the wild. If you come across a plugin that you think is doing something malicious and it&#8217;s on the WordPress plugin repository, contact <em>plugins at wordpress.org</em>. Someone from the review team will take a look at the issue and act accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Complete Transparency Is A Pipe Dream</h3>\n<p>Near the end of the post, Pooria outlines the final goal of transparency.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The final goal of transparency is to encourage all WordPress Users ( Webmasters) to publicly announce all the trackers and cookies of their sites to the public ( visitors and viewers of WordPress Sites).</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a goal that in my opinion, will never be realized. Otto makes a <a title="http://pooriast.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/trackers-wordpress-plugin/comment-page-1/#comment-1391" href="http://pooriast.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/trackers-wordpress-plugin/comment-page-1/#comment-1391">number of points I agree with</a>. I think it&#8217;s asking too much for webmasters to list out ad scripts, cookies, trackers, analytics, etc to their website for public display. In fact, it should be assumed that any webpage a user visits will be running some sort of statistic gathering software or leave cookies behind in the browser. This is the nature of the web. It&#8217;s not like users don&#8217;t have an option to combat these assumptions. There are a myriad of tools available such as browser extensions, desktop software, and privacy settings within the browser.</p>\n<h3>The Correct Way To Gather Usage Info Within Plugins</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to track users of your plugin, I highly suggest going about it the same way as Joost de Valk. <a title="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/" href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/">WordPress SEO</a> developed by Joost de Valk will ask users after they have activated the plugin for the first time whether or not they want to enable tracking.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13369" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/YoastSEOTracking.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13276]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-full wp-image-13369" alt="Yoast SEO Tracking" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/YoastSEOTracking.jpg?resize=327%2C235" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tracking Done The Right Way</p></div>\n<p>This is an acceptable method within the WordPress plugin repository guidelines as it&#8217;s asking for the users consent.</p>\n<h3>Be Up Front and Honest With Users</h3>\n<p>Between the plugin review team and the WordPress community, most users don&#8217;t have anything to worry about. It&#8217;s not that gathering usage information is bad as it&#8217;s a wonderful way to track data to improve software. What&#8217;s bad is gathering that information without anyone knowing it&#8217;s taking place. As a plugin author, do the right thing. Be up front and honest about gathering usage data. Give users the choice and for those users that enable tracking, don&#8217;t give them a reason to lose their trust.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 18:56:25

href="http://buddypress.org/2013/12/buddypress-1-9-sammy/" target="_blank">released</a> to the world today thanks to many volunteer contributors who worked hard to make it happen. This release pays tribute to Sammy&#8217;s Pizza in Providence, Rhode Island, where lead developer John James Jacoby has enjoyed many fine pizza pies.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick tour of the three main highlights of this release.</p>\n<h3>New Notifications Component</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress is introducing a new component for the first time in two years. The 1.9 release has moved notifications to its own component so that they&#8217;re all centralized in one place.<span id="more-12892"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_13294" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/notifications.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[12892]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/notifications.jpg?resize=646%2C498" alt="BuddyPress Notifications" class="size-full wp-image-13294" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">BuddyPress Notifications</p></div>\n<p>Notifications also have an improved API in 1.9 so that developers can easily tie their extensions into them. </p>\n<h3>Dynamic Menu Items</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress site admins will be thrilled to find that 1.9 includes <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/buddypress-1-9-will-include-dynamic-menu-links" target="_blank">dynamic menu links</a>. It&#8217;s now easier than ever to build menus with dynamic links such as &#8220;My Profile&#8221; or &#8220;Settings&#8221; that are specific to logged-in users. Dynamic menu items are separated into logged-in and logged-out user links. </p>\n<div id="attachment_9961" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bp-menus.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[12892]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bp-menus.jpg?resize=732%2C715" alt="Dynamic BuddyPress Menus" class="size-full wp-image-9961" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dynamic BuddyPress Menus</p></div>\n<p>If you previously used a plugin to generate dynamic menu items, you can now delete it and use the built-in BuddyPress links at <strong>Dashboard > Appearance > Menus</strong>.</p>\n<h3>New Widgets</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress 1.9 introduces three new core widgets to help you customize your social network:</p>\n<p><div id="attachment_13296" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/friends-widget.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[12892]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/friends-widget.jpg?resize=225%2C274" alt="Friends Widget" class="size-full wp-image-13296" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Friends Widget</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Friends Widget:</strong> A list of recently active, popular and newest friends of the displayed member.</li>\n<li><strong>Log In Widget:</strong> Adds a simple “Log In” form and/or &#8220;Log Out&#8221; link</li>\n<li><strong>Sitewide Notices Widget:</strong> Displays Sitewide Notices from the Private Messaging component.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Developer Goodies</h4>\n<p>BuddyPress 1.9 reinstates the bp_redirect_canonical() functionality. phpDoc inline documentation has been improved as well as compatibility with the develop.svn.wordpress.org unit-test suite. </p>\n<p>On top of all that, the <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/buddypress-codex-completely-revamped-with-new-design-tutorials-and-guides" target="_blank">BuddyPress Codex has been completely revamped</a> with a design refresh and loads of new tutorials and guides.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress core team is already cooking up new ideas for the 2.0 release but will take some time off for the holidays before getting started. The team will be sending out a brief questionnaire after the beginning of the new year to get community input before setting the goals for BuddyPress 2.0. If you&#8217;re keen on shaping the future of BuddyPress, watch for that questionnaire and make sure to voice your opinion. In the meantime, enjoy all the <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-9/" target="_blank">new goodies packaged into 1.9</a>. It&#8217;s already fully compatible with WordPress 3.8 so you&#8217;re safe to upgrade to the very latest.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 05:47:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.9 “Sammy”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=175601";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"http://buddypress.org/2013/12/buddypress-1-9-sammy/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6622:"<p>Today the BuddyPress team is excited to announce the release of BuddyPress 1.9 &#8220;Sammy&#8221;.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s new in 1.9</h3>\n<p><em>Notifications</em></p>\n<p>BuddyPress has always come packaged with the ability to alert members of relevant goings-on. Things like friend requests, private messages, and group invitations, have been routed through a very simple core process that alerts members via email and a bubble in the top toolbar area. In BuddyPress 1.9, Notifications graduates to a full component, complete with a user interface for seeing past notifications, an improved API for developers to interface with them, and lays the foundation for future improvements and integrations to this functionality.</p>\n<p><em>Navigation Integration</em></p>\n<p>Since WordPress 3.0, site administrators have been able to easily create and manage the navigational elements of their sites, and until now, BuddyPress&#8217;s components have been unavailable as options. In BuddyPress 1.9, we&#8217;re introducing context aware navigation menu items that are only available for either logged in or logged out users, allowing your menus to dynamically adjust for your members. We think this is really cool, and is a feature that will really help integrate BuddyPress into existing installations.</p>\n<p><em>Widgets</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve added a few more widgets to help connect your community to the rest of your site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Friends Widget: a list of recently active, popular, and newest friends of the displayed member.</li>\n<li>Log In Widget: adds a simple “Log In” form to your site.</li>\n<li>Sitewide Notices Widget: display Sitewide Notices from the Private Messaging component.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Developer Bits</em></p>\n<p>BuddyPress 1.9 includes improvements to make it easier to develop plugins and themes for BuddyPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved inline documentation for developers that are crazy enough to go snooping through the code.</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with develop.svn.wordpress.org unit-test suite</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve brought back <code>bp_redirect_canonical()</code> for helping redirect to top level/default members sections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sammy&#8217;s Pizza</h3>\n<p>On the east side of Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.A, on historic Hope St. just a few blocks north of Brown University, sat Sammy&#8217;s Pizza, home to one of the most delicious pizzas I&#8217;ve ever tasted. Sammy&#8217;s was my neighborhood hangout for the 2 years I spent in Providence, and not a day went by I didn&#8217;t stop in and at least say hello. The owner expanded into the next-door property and transformed Sammy&#8217;s into a gorgeous restaurant now known as The Kitchen Bar, where Sammy still continues baking the best pies in New England (in my opinion, anyways.) BuddyPress 1.9 is named &#8220;Sammy&#8221; in honor and memory of the great times I spent with some of my favorite people, eating my favorite foods, in one of my favorite places. If you happen to be in the area, stop in and tell Sammy I say hello!</p>\n<h3>Kudos</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without the continued efforts of a volunteer staff of contributors. If it&#8217;s development, design, wireframes, UI, UX, you name it, these people helped make it happen for BuddyPress 1.9:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/AliMH/">AliMH</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/asakurayoh/">asakurayoh</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges/">boonebgorges</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/burakali/">burakali</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dcavins/">dcavins</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/ddean/">ddean</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/DennisSmolek/">DennisSmolek</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dimensionmedia/">dimensionmedia</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/djpaul/">DJPaul</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dtc7240/">dtc7240</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/ericlewis/">ericlewis</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/gametako/">gametako</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/geoffroycochard/">geoffroycochard</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/graham-washbrook/">graha washbrook</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/hanni/">hanni</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/haykayltduk/">haykayltduk</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/henrywright/">henrywright</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/hnla/">hnla</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/imath/">imath</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/">johnjamesjacoby</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/jessjurick/">jessjurick</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/lenasterg/">lenasterg</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/mboynes/">mboynes</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/megainfo/">megainfo</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/Mike_Cowobo/">Mike_Cowobo</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/modemlooper/">modemlooper</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/olivM/">olivM</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/needle/">needle</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/netweblogic/">netweblogic</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y/">r-a-y</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/ryderlewis/">ryderlewis</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/sbrajesh/">sbrajesh</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/sgr33n/">sgr33n</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/sooskriszta/">sooskriszta</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/terraling/">terraling</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/tomdxw/">tomdxw</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/trishasalas/">trishasalas</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/vhauri/">vhauri</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/williamsba1/">williamsba1</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wpdennis/">wpdennis</a></p>\n<h3>Fin</h3>\n<p>This release cycle, significant effort has gone into improving our documentation.

WordPress loads a number of scripts from its /wp-includes/ directory, depending on what you have active on your site. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/use-wpcom-libraries/" target="_blank">Use WordPress.com Libraries</a> is a new plugin, created by Automattician and plugin developer <a href="https://twitter.com/benlobaugh" target="_blank">Ben Lobaugh</a>. Once installed, it automatically switches the URL on built-in WordPress Javascript files to serve them from the WordPress.com CDN instead. Rather than taxing your local server, you offload those requests to WordPress.com, thereby decreasing load time and bandwidth consumption. <span id="more-13319"></span></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick sample of a site&#8217;s scripts before installing the plugin:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://example.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.10.2''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://example.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.2.1''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://example.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.core.min.js?ver=1.10.3''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://example.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.widget.min.js?ver=1.10.3''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://example.comm/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.min.js?ver=1.10.3''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>The plugin automatically changes the script URLs in use to call the ones hosted on WordPress.com:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.10.2''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.2.1''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.core.min.js?ver=1.10.3''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.widget.min.js?ver=1.10.3''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=''text/javascript'' src=''http://wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.min.js?ver=1.10.3''&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t look for a settings panel, as it doesn&#8217;t come with any options. You simply install the plugin, activate it and you&#8217;re good to go. Everything happens automatically in the background. <strong>As a general warning, make sure to check through your site after installing this in case anything has broken.</strong> In my tests everything worked fine but if you&#8217;re running an older version of WordPress, it may not work predictably. The plugin is still in development and will likely receive updates to improve it over time.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to say how much of a performance boost you&#8217;ll get and how much bandwidth you&#8217;ll save by installing this plugin, because it depends on which scripts you have active on your website and how heavy your traffic is. However, every small bit helps, especially if you&#8217;re not already using a CDN. Install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/use-wpcom-libraries/" target="_blank">Use WordPress.com Libraries</a> plugin for free from the WordPress plugin directory.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 22:15:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: o2 WordPress Plugin Expected To Be Available In Early 2014";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13244";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://www.wptavern.com/o2-wordpress-plugin-expected-to-be-available-in-early-2014";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4158:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/o2SiteLogo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13244]" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13316" alt="o2 Site Logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/o2SiteLogo.jpg?resize=500%2C109" /></a></p>\n<p>In 2008, Automattic created a WordPress theme entitled <a title="http://theme.wordpress.com/retired/prologue/" href="http://theme.wordpress.com/retired/prologue/">Prologue</a>. A year after its launch, Automattic released <a title="http://p2theme.com/" href="http://p2theme.com/">P2</a> to take the place of Prologue. P2 was a revolutionary theme as it enabled communication to happen in near real-time and arranged comments so that they were equally as important as blog posts. From 2009 to 2013, P2 handled <strong>80%</strong> of the communication that took place within the company. Earlier this year at WordCamp San Francisco, Beau Lebens who works at Automattic announced the successor to P2. It won&#8217;t be a theme. Instead, it will be a plugin entitled <a title="http://geto2.com/" href="http://geto2.com/">o2</a>. <span id="more-13244"></span></p>\n<p>o2 is named after the section of the <a title="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/" href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">Automattic creed</a> that states &#8220;<em>I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company</em>&#8220;. o2 was built from the ground up around the idea that communication is oxygen. In this light, the features of o2 make total sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intended to be used within a network</li>\n<li>Focused on the client side or frontend</li>\n<li>Native infinite scroll</li>\n<li>Improved real time commenting</li>\n<li>Cross-site Search (Search multiple o2 instances within a network)</li>\n<li>Cross-posting (Post on more than one o2 site at the same time)</li>\n<li>Keyword + Name Notifications</li>\n<li>Shared Tags</li>\n<li>Email Integration (Post and comment by email)</li>\n<li>Drag and drop media uploading</li>\n<li>Jetpack Integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While o2 is a plugin it will ship with a default theme called <strong>Breathe</strong> based on the <a title="http://underscores.me/" href="http://underscores.me/">Underscores starter theme</a>. o2 is being built as a platform so developers will be able to create plugins and themes to extend its capabilities.</p>\n<h3>The Progress Of o2</h3>\n<p>One of the downsides to o2 is that it will initially not contain any of the network functionality that was mentioned in <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/08/beau-lebens-taking-wordpress-to-the-front-end-with-o2/" title="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/08/beau-lebens-taking-wordpress-to-the-front-end-with-o2/">Beau Lebens WordCamp</a> session. When I asked Beau to clarify, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The initial version is not using websockets, but the AJAX polling is much more efficient and reliable (and accurate) than it ever was in P2.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll still be playing with websockets at some point, but it hasn&#8217;t proven to be critical to making a great experience thus far, so we&#8217;ve pushed it back a bit as a priority. Instead, the commenting system will be an up to date version of P2 which gives us a better foundation to work on top of.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The initial announcement was on August 8th, 2013 but o2 has yet to be released. I reached out to Beau Lebens to get a status update on the project and asked when we might see it become available for public use. He told me that the team is very close to starting a controlled beta or alpha on WordPress.com. Testing will continue into the new year. Once the initial testing program concludes, we&#8217;ll likely see something made available for self installed WordPress users. We can expect this to happen sometime around <strong>February or March of 2014</strong>. Beau Lebens points out that these release dates are very rough estimates, and it depends largely on how things go with the initial trial group.</p>\n<h3>Watch Beau Lebens at WordCamp San Francisco 2013 Announce The o2 Plugin</h3>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 21:35:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: PrettyPress Plugin Reinvents WordPress Post Editing With Live Preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13267";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://www.wptavern.com/prettypress-plugin-reinvents-wordpress-post-editing-with-live-preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2526:"<p>The WordPress post editing experience is one of the next major features that will be evolving to meet the needs of modern publishers. We don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s going to look like yet, but there&#8217;s a trend emerging where everyone is taking a stab at re-imagining the post editor. <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/splitdown-a-free-ghost-style-markdown-editor-for-wordpress" target="_blank">Free</a> and<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/barley-for-wordpress-a-revolutionary-inline-content-editor" target="_blank"> commercial</a> plugins are popping up all over the place, each with a different take on improving the publishing experience.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/prettypress/" title="PrettyPress" target="_blank">PrettyPress</a> is one that landed in the WordPress plugin repository over the weekend. The plugin offers a live front-end preview of your post while you&#8217;re typing. <span id="more-13267"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_13272" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/prettypress-live-preview.png" rel="prettyphoto[13267]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/prettypress-live-preview.png?resize=900%2C463" alt="PrettyPress Live Preview" class="size-full wp-image-13272" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">PrettyPress Live Preview</p></div>\n<p>Essentially, it&#8217;s a Ghost-style editor without the Markdown. You could, however, install another plugin to add Markdown capabilities.</p>\n<p>PrettyPress aims to streamline WordPress publishing by simplifying the editing layout. It removes the distraction of having to switch back and forth between the frontend and backend to preview post formatting. </p>\n<p>While testing the plugin, I appreciated the fact that it doesn&#8217;t completely take over the post/page editor. Instead, it places a &#8220;Launch PrettyPress&#8221; button in the sidebar of the editor so that users can select when to activate the side-by-side screen.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses Javascript and jQuery to create the side-by-side layout with live preview and the PrettyPress developer notes that larger posts may have some performance issues. This is one aspect of the plugin that they plan to improve in the future.

You can pull this out of the /languages/ folder in the package. As a bonus, if you&#8217;re using Twenty Fourteen, you can also find a theme translation within this folder. </p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Create a new directory under wp-content called languages:  <strong>/wp-content/languages/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Upload the en_GB.mo file to the languages directory.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Add this line to your <em>wp-config.php</em> file in the languages section: </p>\n<pre>define(''WPLANG'', ''en_GB'');</pre>\n<p>Save your changes to <em>wp-config.php</em> and upload it to your server. You should now have proper English displayed throughout your installation.</p>\n<p>Note that this same process applies to any other language files as well. Hopefully, this small courtesy will bring some cheer to our friends across the pond!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 19:54:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: Help Build CF Community: A Social Network for People with Cystic Fibrosis";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=12941";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://www.wptavern.com/help-build-cf-community-a-social-network-for-people-with-cystic-fibrosis";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13233:"<p>Imagine being born with a genetic disease that causes your lungs to fill, making it hard, sometimes impossible, to breathe. Imagine being susceptible to lung infections and a shorter life expectancy than everyone else. Imagine coughing attacks, feeling as though you&#8217;re drowning, regular hospital stays, and the fear of an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that thousands of others also share this genetic disease but you won&#8217;t ever be able to meet with them in person. You won&#8217;t be able to get together to share stories, a shoulder, a helping hand, a hug, or build a community of support and encouragement.<span id="more-12941"></span></p>\n<p>This is the reality for those living with cystic fibrosis. People with CF are not allowed to have contact with one another. Because of a high susceptibility to lung infections, they can easily infect each other just by hanging out. Highly resistant bacteria can be shared between those with CF that can lead to serious declines in lung function and more vicious illnesses that are harder to treat, ultimately reducing life expectancy.</p>\n<p>This is the issue being tackled by BuddyPress developer, consultant and community builder Bowe Frankema. Bowe lives with cystic fibrosis and has mounted a campaign to create a social network dedicated to bringing this community together virtually, since they cannot meet together in person. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We were able to catch up with Bowe and ask him some questions about this project, CFCommunity.net, what it will mean for the cystic fibrosis community, the technology behind it, and what the open source community has meant to him personally. </p>\n<p><strong>Tavern:</strong><em> When did it occur to you that BuddyPress and WordPress would be a perfect fit for the CF Community?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bowe:</strong> The first time I visited the BuddyPress Community forums back in 2009. I already tried out BuddyPress, but wasn’t sure if it could do the job. The software was still in it’s early days and the learning curve was through the roof! I did have experience in web development and community building so I got just enough of it, to dive in deeper. </p>\n<p>I visited the support forums to ask some questions, and was blown away by the community there. <span class="pullquote alignleft">Seeing this group of people working together to create software that was free for anyone to use, baffled me. Where was the catch? Why were these people doing this for free? </span></p>\n<p>BuddyPress introduced me to the concept of Open Source and working together on creating something that benefits everyone. As soon as I “got” it I never looked back and knew that I wanted to build CFCommunity on WordPress/BuddyPress. </p>\n<p><strong>Tavern:</strong> <em>Will you be building / designing the site yourself? Or will you be getting a team to help you?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bowe:</strong> This is definitely a team effort. It’s funny that I’m able to type that with so much confidence, because it took me a long time to get to this point. I had the crazy idea that a non-profit project could be developed, managed and funded by this one guy, who also happens to have CF and can’t even work full time. It’s funny how your ambitions can make you set these unrealistic goals. As soon as I started talking about CFCommunity to my friends, they had these amazing ideas on how to make it happen. </p>\n<p>Registering as an official cause, doing a crowdfunding campaign and helping getting the word out, it’s all done with the help of the input of my friends. Especially Mason and Siobhan have been great friends and mentors! </p>\n<p>If we reach our goal we’ll be starting the development fairly soon. We’re still looking for a BuddyPress/WordPress plugin developer and someone who’s experienced with WP/BP Theme Development. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/registration.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/registration.jpg?resize=560%2C212" alt="registration" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13236" /></a></p>\n<p>Besides the geek stuff there’s a lot of work we need to put in building the community. Translations, finding moderators, writing quality copy and getting the word out. It’s going to be fun :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Tavern:</strong> <em>What kinds of new plugins will you need to create to serve the CF community specifically?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bowe:</strong> We have a few very specific plugins in mind that we’d like to develop for the community. Here’s some of them:</p>\n<p><em>I’m in the hospital :-(</em> &#8211; This is a button on your profile that you press when you’re in the hospital. You can put in your address + room number and your friends will get notified. They will then be able to quickly send you a physical get well card or an e-card. </p>\n<p><em>Memorial Profiles</em> &#8211; The world of CF can be very grim, and over the years we’ve lost some of our friends due to CF. We have created memorial pages for those we lost, where we share stories, pictures and memories. We’d like to have a place for this on CFCommunity. We have ideas for doing this in such a way that a memorial page remains private for a small group of friends connected to the person who passed away. </p>\n<p><em>Donations / Supporter Sytem</em> &#8211; A lightweight plugin that simply allows users to make recurring donations to our community. These supporters are automatically listed on a special page and have a special badge on their profile. </p>\n<p><em>Cause/Organisation Groups</em> &#8211; We’d like to give CF related causes the ability to create a group similar to a Discussion Group. The big difference is that they would be able to tell something about their cause. The biggest benefit for having these pages for CF related causes/organisations is making it very easy for our members to find places they could contact for information or support. </p>\n<p><em>Welcome Messages</em> &#8211; On CFCommunity we will have hosts who are welcoming our new members. In order to help new members we’ll automatically send them a welcome message in their native language by one of the hosts assigned to that country. </p>\n<p>These are a few unique plugins, but a ton of time is also spent on integrating and extending existing plugins that are perfect for our cause. One of the things we’re most excited about is using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/achievements/" target="_blank">Achievements</a> plugin to reward our members for things like taking their meds, gaining weight or exercising.</p>\n<p><strong>Tavern:</strong> <em> If you&#8217;re able to reach your funding goals, how long do you think it will take to build out the new CF Community site? And have you thought about a stretch goal?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bowe:</strong> We’re aiming for a launch at the end of spring. The last 30% is always the hardest, and we have quite a bit of challenges to solve. It’s not just a technical thing, a lot of things are related to community building and finding the right people to lead the way. We’re planning to write about this process in more detail as the CFCommunity comes closer to launch!</p>\n<p>If we go over our funding goal one of the first things I’d like to do is create a similar plugin as Commons in a Box but then for causes. Basically it would be a plugin suite + theme that would allow anyone to quickly start a social network for their cause. I think it would be awesome to drastically lower the barrier for people to create these types of communities. I honestly believe WordPress is the perfect platform for these type of communities, so I hope we’ll get to that point after we’ve launched CFCommunity. </p>\n<p><strong>Tavern:</strong> <em>How has being involved with the WordPress and BuddyPress community changed your life?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bowe:</strong> Story time! Average life expectancy for people with CF is around 40, I never realized how much everything I did was influenced by this. I badly wanted to leave my mark on everything I did. I was driven by an unhealthy fear of missing out on life. My entire life I had been taking shortcuts to achieve as much as possible in the shortest amount of time. </p>\n<p>This is something that I’ve heard from many of my friends with CF, we’re simply not allowing ourselves to plan a real future for ourselves. <span class="pullquote alignleft">Often friends and family would praise me for being so driven and ambitious but I was driven by the fear that I was in the prime time of my life.</span> I neglected my treatments, skipped my meds and was constantly asking too much of my body. I certainly wasn’t in the best state of mind.  </p>\n<p>Things changed when I met an old friend who strongly advised me to see a different doctor. He really helped me change my perspective on life and helped me to stay motivated.</p>\n<p>I needed to start planning for the future, think long-term and manage my energy. Find things that would give meaning to my life but are actually achievable and do not have a negative impact on my health. Plan for the future. I decided that I wanted to plan a large part of my future around WordPress.</p>\n<p>WordPress has allowed me to build my career doing the things I’ve always loved doing; being creative, working with people, and give weight to my work through meaningful projects . </p>\n<p>I’ve made real friends through WordPress and most of these friends are now helping me with CFCommunity.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignleft">WordPress allows me to have an impact on others through my work. It has given me the chance to see the world through WordCamps and BuddyCamps.</span> It allows me to stand on my own feet and move from a small city in the Netherlands to the amazing city of Berlin. It allows me to work in my own pace and from anywhere. </p>\n<p>It’s an amazing idea that my work has impact on others across the world, and I have WordPress and it’s community to thank for it. </p>\n<p><strong>Tavern:</strong> <em>What is your ultimate hope for this community, on a heart level, where do you want it to go? In what ways do you hope that it will improve the lives of people with CF?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bowe:</strong> When I was twelve my parents heard about these summer camps for kids with Cystic Fibrosis and thought it would be a good idea to sent me there. Those weeks have taught me more about living with CF than any doctor, family member or book could ever tell me. For seven days a year I would spent time with kids who truly understood what it was like being different. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bowe.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bowe.jpg?resize=560%2C298" alt="bowe" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13217" /></a></p>\n<p>While I was running around on the field playing a game of soccer with the well kids, we had ill kids, those who were sick at the time, cheering for us on the side of the field with IVs in their arms. I learned to accept CF as part of me, and be grateful that I was doing so well compared to others.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignleft">The idea that kids who are struggling with coming to grips with their Cystic Fibrosis, would never be able to experience what it was like to be accepted and understood in such a profound way really got to me.<br />\n</span><br />\nSo my ultimate goal with CFCommunity is to create something that could help people affected by CF to go through life a little easier. Last year my cousin gave birth to a beautiful girl who sadly also has CF. She’ll never be able to meet others with CF in real life and I know one day she’d like to meet others with CF. I want to create that place for her and everyone else affected by CF. How awesome would it be if she knew it was her uncle who made that happen? Being in a position to do these things is proof that I made the right decision to make WordPress such a big part of my life :-)</p>\n<h3>Help Make the CFCommunity a Reality</h3>\n<p>The project has already garnered the backing of some serious talent, including Mason James, Siobhan McKeown, Tom Wilmot, Tammie Lister and Sarah Smit.

href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>One of the challenges of migrating a WordPress site is performing a search and replace within the database to update all of the links to the new URL. There are even more links to update on a multisite installation and you&#8217;re often working with a larger database. Today we&#8217;re going to look at a few handy tools that will make your life much easier when migrating a site. The tool you select usually depends on when you prefer to perform the search and replace.<span id="more-13165"></span></p>\n<h4>Migrate DB Plugin: Requires Admin Access</h4>\n<p>If you have access to the WordPress admin, one of the easiest ways to make the changes up front is to use the Migrate DB plugin. Jeff recently <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-wp-db-migrate" target="_blank">reviewed</a> it if you&#8217;d like to read more about how the plugin works. Essentially, you input your new URL and file path and the plugin exports an updated version of the database, which you would then import into an empty database on your new server.</p>\n<div id="attachment_11448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WPDBMigrateOptions.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WPDBMigrateOptions.jpg?resize=560%2C417" alt="WP DB Migrate Options" class="size-full wp-image-11448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Changing the site URL is easy!</p></div>\n<h4>Search and Replace WordPress Plugin: Requires Admin Access</h4>\n<p>In the event that you&#8217;ve already moved the site over to the new server and have already imported the database, you have a couple different options for performing your search and replace. One of them is to use phpmyadmin or a similar tool to update the home and site URLs so that you can get back into the WordPress admin. At that point you could use a plugin such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search-and-replace/" target="_blank">Search and Replace</a> to update URLs, site name or anything else that&#8217;s necessary.</p>\n<p>This plugin lets you search over all or perform a more specific search in ID, post-content, GUID, titel, excerpt, meta-data, comments, comment-author, comment-e-mail, comment-url, tags/categories and categories-description.</p>\n<h4>Search and Replace DB Script: Does Not Require Admin Access</h4>\n<p>Another option that I&#8217;ve used many times is the <a href="http://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/" target="_blank">Search and Replace DB</a> tool. It&#8217;s not a WordPress plugin, but it&#8217;s very easy to use. This script preserves serialized PHP strings when performing a search and replace. You upload the script to your site, scan all the tables and then input what you want to find and replace.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13207" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/searchreplacev2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/searchreplacev2.jpg?resize=560%2C427" alt="Scan tables" class="size-full wp-image-13207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scan tables</p></div>\n<p>Although you can use this script with Drupal, Joomla or any similar CMS, it was made to work nicely with the unique requirements of WordPress migrations and includes a few key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Handles multiple nested serializations (sometimes present in transient values)</li>\n<li>Handles multi-byte Unicode changes safely (important for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name" target="_blank">internationalized domain names</a>)</li>\n<li>Option to skip guid column for migrating sites that are already live</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The important thing to remember after using the <a href="http://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/" target="_blank">Search and Replace DB script</a> is that you must remember to remove it from your website once you&#8217;re finished. Otherwise, it poses a serious security risk.</p>\n<p>Of course there are many more tools than those listed here that perform similar functions. These three above are ones that I&#8217;ve tested multiple times and found to be the easiest and most efficient for getting the job done.  Do you know of any other outstanding migration tools? Let us know in the comments below.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 21:34:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: Get More Admin Color Schemes For WordPress 3.8";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=13179";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://www.wptavern.com/get-more-admin-color-schemes-for-wordpress-3-8";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2926:"<p>One of my favorite features of the <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released" target="_blank">WordPress 3.8</a> &#8216;About&#8217; page is the live admin color scheme picker.

You might be surprised to know that the backbone of the color schemes is just a handful of variables included in its scss file, defining the base, highlight, notification and action colors. You&#8217;ll need to compile your new scss file into a corresponding CSS file in order to make it work. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemes/" title="Admin Color Schemes plugin" target="_blank">Admin Color Schemes</a> offers a nice model for how to do this.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 19:40:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress.tv: Tammie Lister: The Life of a Theme";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=27091";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/12/12/tammie-lister-the-life-of-a-theme/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:681:"<div id="v-hSBB9Vtg-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/27091/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/27091/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=27091&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/12/12/tammie-lister-the-life-of-a-theme/"><img alt="wceu-2013-The Life of a Theme-Tammie-Lister" src="http://videos.videopress.com/hSBB9Vtg/wceu-2013-the-life-of-a-theme-tammie-lister_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 19:12:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"Ping-O-Matic: Bits of Advice on Growth and Readership";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://blog.pingomatic.com/?p=98";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://blog.pingomatic.com/2013/12/12/growth-and-readership/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3398:"<p>In the past, we&#8217;ve shared quick optimization tips, sharing plugins, and other tools to help drive traffic to your site. Over on <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><em>The Daily Post</em></a>, we&#8217;ve published interviews with popular bloggers on growing your site and building your readership.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-99" alt="statwrangling" src="http://pingomatic.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/statwrangling.png?w=600&h=267" width="600" height="267" /></p>\n<p>Here are snippets from <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/cristian-mihai/" target="_blank">a great Q&amp;A</a> with author <a href="http://cristianmihai.net/" target="_blank">Cristian Mihai</a>.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s your secret to building such a large following?</h3>\n<blockquote><p>The secret is to do something you’re passionate about, something you care deeply about. Because if you do so, odds are that someone else will relate to what you’re doing. If every post you write means something to you, it’ll undoubtedly mean something to other people, too.</p>\n<p>Another key aspect is consistency. It’s not all about quantity — posting every day, for instance — but also about quality. Readers should know what to expect every time they get notified that you posted something new on your blog.</p>\n<p>Blogging is not a numbers game. Yes, as you become more popular it’s easy to lose track of things; it becomes more and more difficult to realize that those numbers are actually people. Every like, comment, and follow is an action performed by another human being.</p>\n<p>Statistics only offer you a cold perspective of what’s going on with your blog, but what matters more is the level of interaction that you manage with fellow bloggers. Also, if you think too much about followers and such, you’re going to try too hard. And you’re going to fail.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>What types of posts perform better?</h3>\n<blockquote><p>It’s almost impossible to determine why some posts perform better than others. Sometimes it’s ironic, because you worked really hard on a certain piece — did a lot of research, tried to make it all come together in the most attractive way possible — and you just don’t get people to care enough to leave a comment. Other times, the exact opposite happens.</p>\n<p>Popularity simply means how many people relate to what you’re doing. Engagement means how many people care enough — whether they agree or disagree — to actually respond. The goal is to figure out what it is that makes people follow your blog. What type of posts do they enjoy reading most? That’s when your stats may prove useful. If you analyze the posts that perform better, you’ll see they’re often similar in theme, structure, and so on. That’s what readers want most.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Read <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/cristian-mihai/" target="_blank">this entire interview on blog growth and readership</a>.</em></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/98/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/98/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.pingomatic.com&blog=68432&post=98&subd=pingomatic&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 19:07:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Cheri Lucas Rowlands";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"WPTavern: WordPress 3.8 “Parker” Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=11632";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9584:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/" title="http://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/">WordPress 3.8 &#8220;Parker&#8221; has been released</a>, named for jazz artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker">Charlie Parker</a>. Version 3.8 has been in the oven for 49 days. This marks the second release that contains features that started off as plugins first, a <a title="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-core-development-goes-to-warp-speed-with-features-as-plugins-model" href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-core-development-goes-to-warp-speed-with-features-as-plugins-model">development practice</a> we&#8217;ve covered on WPTavern at great length. It&#8217;s important to note that after upgrading to WordPress 3.8, you are strongly encouraged to disable and remove any of the features that started off as plugins. For example, since MP6 was merged into core, it&#8217;s no longer needed and will automatically be disabled after you upgrade.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13047" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38About.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-large wp-image-13047" alt="WordPress 3.8 About Page" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38About.jpg?resize=500%2C300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 3.8 About Page</p></div>\n<p><span id="more-11632"></span></p>\n<h3>A New Theme Experience (Formerly Known As THX)</h3>\n<div id="attachment_13010" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38THX.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-large wp-image-13010" alt="WordPress 3.8 Theme Experience" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38THX.jpg?resize=500%2C259" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The New WordPress Theme Experience</p></div>\n<p>Browsing and switching themes from the backend of WordPress is now a much better experience thanks to a completely revamped themes page. The themes page now has larger thumbnails making it easier to browse themes at a glance. Clicking the theme details link displays a large screenshot of the theme as well as a detailed description on the right hand side.</p>\n<h3>Widgets Area Chooser (Formerly Known As The Widget Area Chooser Plugin)</h3>\n<div id="attachment_13015" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38WidgetManagement.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-full wp-image-13015" alt="WordPress 3.8 Widget Management" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38WidgetManagement.jpg?resize=269%2C253" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">New Way To Manage Widgets</p></div>\n<p>The days of scrolling endlessly to manage Widgets are over. WordPress 3.8 enhances the Widget management pages in a few key areas. Sidebars now make better use of free space on wide screen monitors by adding a side-by-side display. You no longer have to drag widgets into the sidebar, although you&#8217;ll still be able to. An alternative method is to click on the widget and select the sidebar you&#8217;d like to have it displayed on. Select the sidebar location and click the add widget button. This is a huge improvement, especially for those who use a lot of widgets.</p>\n<h3>A Refined Dashboard With Widget Improvements (Formerly Known As DASH)</h3>\n<p>The WordPress 3.8 dashboard has reworked a number of widgets to make them more useful. During the development phase, the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/10/11/dash-update-4/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/10/11/dash-update-4/">incoming links widget was removed</a> since it routinely didn&#8217;t work. The WordPress Blog, Other WordPress News, and Plugins widgets were combined to form the new WordPress News widget. The Right Now widget has been renamed to &#8220;<em>At a Glance</em>&#8220;. This widget shows how many posts, pages and comments are on the site as well as the current version of WordPress installed. Akismet stats now make up the bottom portion of the widget.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13026" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38DashboardRevamp.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-large wp-image-13026" alt="Removed, Merged, And Revamped Dashboard Widgets" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38DashboardRevamp.jpg?resize=500%2C240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Removed, Merged, And Revamped Dashboard Widgets</p></div>\n<p>Recent Comments was merged into the new Activity widget which also shows any scheduled posts and the five most recently published posts. Last but not least, QuickPress was renamed to Quick Drafts which also houses the Recent Drafts widget. There is no longer an option to specify how many columns the dashboard has. Instead, the number of columns will automatically change based on the available screen real estate. Developers can hook into the activity widget and add additional information to it.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Backend Redesign (Formerly Known As MP6)</h3>\n<p>The most noticeable change in WordPress 3.8 is the renovated backend design. This redesign has been <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/">nine months in the making</a> with the creation of the MP6 plugin. The new design is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Typography has gotten some major improvements thanks to the use of Open Sans.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13027" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38AdminColorSchemes.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-large wp-image-13027" alt="WordPress 3.8 Has Eight Different Color Schemes" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38AdminColorSchemes.jpg?resize=500%2C156" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 3.8 Has Eight Different Color Schemes</p></div>\n<p>If dark colors are not your style, WordPress 3.8 ships with eight different color schemes. My personal favorite is Midnight. It&#8217;s possible that in the near future, a large number of color schemes will be available via an add-on plugin.</p>\n<h3>The New Default Theme TwentyFourteen</h3>\n<div id="attachment_13028" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38TwentyFourteenDefaultThemes.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13028" alt="WordPress 3.8 Default Theme TwentyFourteen" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38TwentyFourteenDefaultThemes.jpg?resize=300%2C190" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 3.8 Default Theme TwentyFourteen</p></div>\n<p>TwentyFourteen marks the first time a new WordPress default theme is available for a full year. TwentyFourteen, previously known as Further, was originally created as a theme for WordPress.com. Based on Further&#8217;s success, it became an ideal candidate to be turned into the default theme. The theme is based around a magazine concept and includes up to six featured content blocks. Use the three widget areas to customize your website, and change your content’s layout with a full width page template and a contributor page to show off your authors.</p>\n<h3>Responsive Admin Design</h3>\n<div id="attachment_13045" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38ResponsiveDesign.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-large wp-image-13045" alt="WordPress 3.8 Responsive Admin" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WP38ResponsiveDesign.jpg?resize=500%2C183" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 3.8 Backend Is Now Responsive</p></div>\n<p>The backend of WordPress 3.8 is now responsive. The WordPress backend now adapts to any device such as a smartphone, tablet, notebook, or desktop. This is incredibly helpful to those who use WordPress mobile apps on smartphones and need to access specific administrative functions in the backend of WordPress. In previous versions, navigating through the backend on a mobile device was painfully slow. Some of the increase in speed can be attributed to using vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By discarding pixels, pages load faster.</p>\n<h3>WordPress 3.8 Is The Best Release Yet</h3>\n<p><div id="attachment_13172" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CharlieParker.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CharlieParker.jpg?resize=217%2C300" alt="WordPress 3.8 Charlie Parker" class="size-medium wp-image-13172" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlie Parker</p></div>I didn&#8217;t realize how many changes are in WordPress 3.8 until I wrote this post. There are a lot of user facing features and enhancements that will take some getting used to. However, I think all of the improvements make it the best release so far. </p>\n<p>The default theme has a specific use case but I&#8217;m curious to see how the WordPress community will re-imagine TwentyFourteen using child themes. Last but not least, thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 3.8 either by way of submitting patches, reporting bugs, or beta testing the software. It&#8217;s your dedication that enabled 3.8 to ship on time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 17:00:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.8 “Parker”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2765";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17605:"<p>Version 3.8 of WordPress, named “Parker” in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker">Charlie Parker</a>, bebop innovator, is available <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">for download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2967" alt="themes" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789" alt="The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg. This is our second release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. We think it’s been going great.

This has been a very positive trend, with Bluehost and DreamHost also dedicating full time positions to core WordPress development.  At Automattic we have entire team of people working on the WordPress.org project.</p>\n<p>Not everyone is in a position to have a full time developer or designer dedicated just to the WordPress project.  There are other ways of helping though.  A good example is <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/giving-back-wordpress/" title="Funny how different people get the same good idea at the same time.">WP Site Care, who is dedicating time each week for employees to help in the WordPress support forums</a>.  Ryan Sullivan summed it up nicely at the end of his announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI also realized that everyone has a place. We don’t employ anyone with core contributor skills here (yet), but we’re damn good at support, and that’s something we can give back in a very meaningful and effective way.</p>\n<p>So I’m proud to announce that all WP Site Care team members will be contributing time weekly to the WordPress Support Forums and Docs.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the idea of building off of your existing strengths to help out the rest of the WordPress community.

He referenced Pooria Asteraky’s discovery that a social sharing plugin had applied 13 trackers on a vanilla installation. This is no surprise, really, as a site owner installs social sharing plugins with the express purpose of sending information out from the website via Javascript or some other means. Otto left a comment on the original post, clarifying which trackers might indeed be harmful or unwanted. He said, “Our primary concern in this regard would be plugins that do things without the consent or without the knowledge of the website owner.” This is an important distinction to make, as many trackers perform a welcome and valuable service, such as Jetpack stats, Gravatar or Google Analytics. The trackers you want to hunt down are those that collect information about users or activities on the site without consent. Let’s hunt trackers! Since plugin authors may not always be transparent about what kinds of trackers their plugins install, especially if they’re not hosted on WordPress.org, site owners need some way to sniff these out. That’s where a free tool like Ghostery comes in handy for finding out what services might be communicating to and from a website. It operates as a browser extension and there are versions available for Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE, iOS and Firefox for Android. Here’s an example of what it looks like when I installed it to Chrome, which was painless and instant.  Once installed, the extension looks for third-party page elements (or “trackers”) on the web pages you visit and displays them in the corner of your browser. It verifies these trackers against Ghostery’s extensive library of more than  1,700 trackers and 3,400 tracking patterns, including beacons, advertisements, analytics services, page widgets, and other third-party page elements.  Get the Details Behind the Trackers If you suspect that a plugin might be “phoning home” from your website, inserting ads or invisible pixels for tracking, Ghostery gives you a quick way to track down the tracker and find out who is behind it. It’s not just for use on your own website – you can check out other sites as well. Here’s a quick example run on a WordPress.org plugin page:  You can click on each individual tracker to see the URL and find out more information. For the most part, you’ll see a harmless list like the one above. The Ghostery tool comes in handy if you feel that you may have been hacked or have noticed some suspicious activity on your site. The information Ghostery provides will help you to investigate your plugins and/or themes to find the culprit. It’s also useful for inspecting other sites for a small window into their third-party connections. Block Unwanted Trackers Ghostery also lets visitors block trackers based on the type of function they perform or on an individual basis. This is particularly useful if you want to block trackers that violate your privacy by collecting your behavioral data.  The ultimate goal here is to use Ghostery to find more information about invisible trackers and control your privacy online. Though it has a broad use outside of WordPress, Ghostery provides a first line of defense for finding plugins that “phone home” and using that knowledge to disable them and report on their activities.''>WPTavern: How to Use Ghostery to Find Trackers Added by WordPress Plugins</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://wptavern.com/edit-posts-from-within-the-preview-screen-with-post-customizer'' title=''There are all sorts of frontend editors being created for WordPress. We’ve already covered Barley, Inline Access, and PrettyPress. Each plugin takes a different approach to solving the problem. Post Customizer, developed by 10up continues the trend of taking a different approach to solving the problem of live editing. Post Customizer works in a similar fashion to the theme customizer. When a user previews a page or a post, an interface is loaded that looks just like the theme customizer. From this interface, you can edit the post excerpt, post thumbnail, save changes to the post or close the interface without saving. Selecting text within the post displays a simple editor that makes it easy to style words, apply unordered lists etc. Simple editor to edit posts Idea Turned Into Reality I got in touch with John James Jacoby, one of several developers for the plugin (along with Carl Danley, John Bloch, Taylor Lovett, and Drew Jaynes). I found out why the plugin was created, the decision to use the customizer interface and whether or not this is just a prototype or something they want people to use on a routine basis. Tavern – Is this plugin a prototype of an idea to edit posts or does 10up plan on improving the plugin? Does 10up want people to use it? JJJ – Both! It was an idea I’ve had in my head for a while, and we threw it together at our company meetup and then it sat mostly unloved for a few months. We spent a few hours getting it to a workable state, and open sourced it for improvements and feedback. We actually built the majority of it over the course of two evenings, just hacking together and rapidly prototyping. Tavern – When it comes to the post customizer, does it not make sense to be able to have the category and tags be editable from within the customizer? At that point, you’re sort of substituting the post writing screen although you don’t see the customizing interface until after you hit preview. JJJ – Sure. Pretty much any metabox is game for inclusion. We specifically wanted to provide an interface for editing post content after the original post was written. We’d like to work Revisions into the sidebar, so authors can scroll through updates live. Nice Idea But Needs A Lot Of Elbow Grease While the idea is great, the implementation and experience needs to be improved before users can feel comfortable with using this plugin. Here are some things I noticed. Update Or Save – The theme customizer that the interface is based on does not feel natural when editing posts. When editing themes, I realize an update will save the changes I made to the theme. For posts however, I’m used to clicking a save button. While the update button does the same thing, it just doesn’t seem right. Exiting The Interface – I’m used to closing interfaces with an X on the top right portion of the screen. Despite the post customizer using a familiar layout, I keep looking to the right of the screen for a way to close the editing panel. It’s as simple as clicking the close button but I’m always looking somewhere else to get out of the editing interface.  It’s also weird that upon closing the editing panel, I’m taken back to the WordPress editing screen that’s missing the right sidebar. It’s here that I have to click an X to completely close the editing interface. Clicking close and then the X feels redundant. I’d rather see the close button take the role of doing both tasks and returning me to the normal editing panel without any additional steps. Editor Toolbar Sticks To The Top Of The Post – When the editing toolbar is enabled, it sticks to the top of the page. While I could use keyboard shortcuts, I’d rather see the editor appear above the text I’m highlighting so I don’t have to scroll or move my mouse so much. When the edited text is not highlighted, the toolbar should disappear. Excerpts Reload The Entire Page – The first time you try to edit the excerpt in the sidebar, it reloads the entire page along with the interface. I found this to be a jarring experience and would like to see the excerpt loaded without having to reload the entire page.  Interesting Take On The Post Editing Idea I never would have thought that the theme customizer interface could be used to edit posts. Post Customizer proves the idea has merit. It will be interesting to see how this plugin evolves over time.

Over time she realized yoga was also making her a better human.\r\n\r\nShe received her 200 hr Yoga Teacher Training from The Lotus Centre in London, ON in 2010. Since then, her practice and teachings have deepened through trainings with Master Yoga teachers such as Todd Norian (Ashaya Yoga - Touch of Grace Hands-on Adjustments Teacher Training), Sadie Nardini (Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga - Revolution Teacher Training) as well as Brenda Dowell (DevaTree School of Yoga - Beyond the Basics; Advanced Asana Teacher Training) to name a few.\r\n\r\nShe continues to strive to live and breathe yoga each moment through the good times and bad times, while holding on to the teachings that have molded her thus far. It is an approach that keeps her grounded, balanced and happy.

Soon Kim''s passions for teaching, yoga and improving physical and mental health began to evolve into a career beyond the educational system. In 2012, Kim received her 200 hr Yoga Teacher certification from Maha Pura Yoga Studio in Guelph, ON and is registered with <a href="http://yogaalliance.org/">Yoga Alliance</a>.

What Chantelle thought was just another form of exercise, quickly became so much more.\r\n\r\nAs a survivor of domestic violence, Chantelle experienced first hand the incredible healing power yoga has on the mind, body and soul. She also noticed she was sick with colds and flu less often and was better prepared to face the stresses of day to day life.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a decade of being a classroom teacher, Chantelle left teaching to pursue her passion for yoga. In 2007, she traveled to Miramar, Florida to study under Master Yogi Hari Sukhu of the Sivananda lineage and receive her 200-hour yoga teacher certification. Not sure if she made the right choice, Chantelle continued to teach a few yoga classes but returned to school a year later and received her certification in Public Relations and Communications from Fanshawe College. She was immediately hired upon graduation with digital agency, rtraction, as their client relations manager, but it only took a few years before yoga called her back. From colleagues asking her for yogic advice on personal life issues and how to loosen tense muscles to being requested to teach private group classes and speaking about workplace wellness for a Regional Mental Health Care Lunch and Learn at St. Joseph''s Hospital, Chantelle realized there was a high need for yoga and effective stress management in the workplace. In January of 2013, Chantelle left rtraction and began to pour her heart and soul into creating Prana Yoga &amp; Wellness, which officially launched in October 2013 and she hasn''t looked back since. Chantelle is registered as an experienced yoga teacher with <a href="http://yogaalliance.org/">Yoga Alliance.</a>\r\n\r\nChantelle also offers classical hatha yoga classes through <a href="fcssc.ca/register/more/5">Forest City Sport &amp; Social Club</a>, <a href="http://www.downtownlondonyoga.ca/Calendarbyteacher.aspx">Downtown Yoga Holistic Centre </a>and at her private home studio.\r\n\r\nTwitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/paisley_girl73">@paisley_girl73</a>\r\nBlog: <a href="http://www.neverwateraweed.blogspot.ca/">neverwateraweed.blogspot.ca</a>', 'About', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'about', '', '', '2013-11-25 21:44:06', '2013-11-25 21:44:06', '', 0, 'http://prana.gav.rtr/?page_id=2', 0, 'page', '', 0),

While these are good places to start, when it comes to true wellness, Prana believes emotional and mental fitness also plays an important role. The World Health Organization (WHO) agrees. They have defined positive mental health as “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her potential, can cope with normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. In the workplace there can be no health without mental health.”\r\n\r\n<strong>WHAT WE OFFER</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile there is no magic pill or quick fix, the Prana team has tools to offer that when practiced over time will help your employees build resilience to stress, thereby promoting and protecting your team’s well being.\r\n\r\nWe offer both "on-the-mat" and "off-the-mat" services for executives and staff in your corporate space. Choose our services individually or combine them for a complete workplace wellness package:\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Yoga classes in the office before or after work and/or during the lunch hour</li>\r\n <li>8-week "Live &amp; Learn" stress management course focusing on mindfulness, positive psychology, relaxation methods and breathing exercises</li>\r\n  <li>Seminars, workshops, retreats related to work-life balance, mental-emotional wellness, stress management and self-care.</li>\r\n  <li>30-minute Mindfulness classes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of our programming is created with the intention of providing professionals with tools to help them better manage stress in their lives and to feel happier at work and in life:\r\n<blockquote>"I attended two of Chantelle’s wellness workshops at a Fanshawe College faculty retreat day and they were extremely well done. The combination of Chantelle’s skills as a teacher / facilitator and her passion for yoga were evident throughout the sessions, and it was an enlightening and positive experience for all of the participants.\r\n\r\nAfter attending both wellness workshops, I was motivated to take Chantelle’s yoga classes. Chantelle really makes her students feel welcome, and she fosters an environment where her students feel safe trying new poses. Chantelle is also very encouraging when she sees our progress, and she makes us feel successful in our own practice.\r\n\r\nI am new to yoga and find I look forward to every Wednesday evening and my time with Chantelle. I feel more relaxed and centered after each class, and I also find I’m often reflecting on something she said during our class that really resonated with me. I believe my life is changing is positive ways because of Chantelle and all that I''m learning from her. "\r\n\r\n-Jackie W.</blockquote>\r\n<strong>WHY IT''S IMPORTANT</strong>\r\n\r\nIn January of 2013, The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Group released the new National Standard of Canada on Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace in response to some compelling statistics on how chronic stress, anxiety and depression are affecting working Canadians. It is estimated that Canada spends $51-billion per year on absenteeism, productivity, indemnities and healthcare as a result of mental health disorders. These new standards will play an important role to employers wishing to achieve the rank of “top employer” and implement best practices.\r\n\r\nBy implementing an approach to workplace wellness that targets stress management and overall well-being, organizations can more effectively:\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>recruit and retain employees</li>\r\n <li>increase productivity and profit</li>\r\n <li>reduce costs related to employee sick leave, health plan expenses and workers'' compensation and disability claims</li>\r\n <li>build a stronger team and boost morale</li>\r\n <li>control costs due to employee absenteeism and “presenteeism”*</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n*presenteeism is a term to describe employees who are physically at work, but due to stress are highly distracted and mentally preoccupied, which greatly affects productivity.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Workplace Wellness', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'workplace-wellness', '', '', '2013-11-12 19:28:16', '2013-11-12 19:28:16', '', 0, 'http://prana.gav.rtr/?page_id=9', 0, 'page', '', 0),

We want to watch your progress and be there to celebrate your milestones. It’s important to us that we learn how your body moves, that you are confident while practicing yoga alone or in a group, and that you feel comfortable asking us questions and providing feedback.\r\n\r\nThere are many different styles of yoga available today. What we offer is classical hatha yoga, which is a great foundation for all other styles of yoga. Our classes are designed with a core sequence of postures that are used by all our teachers so you can experience progress, mastery and the full relaxation benefits of your practice. As your practice progresses, more variations and new asanas (poses), as well as other styles of yoga are introduced.\r\n\r\nWhat? No studio? Nope.\r\n\r\nIn true yogi fashion we are not fixed to one space. We have the ability to teach yoga wherever you are: at home, at the office or at a park. All of our teachers also instruct classes with other local studios if you prefer a studio group experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>CORPORATE YOGA</strong>\r\nLooking to de-stress at work? Our Prana Yoga teachers are here to help. We offer 60-minute on-site classes which are ideal before work, during the lunch hour or after work. It’s a great team building activity, too! (Pssst... if your employer won''t subsidize the classes, self organize and divide the cost between you and your colleagues!) Fees: $75 + HST per class (up to 15 people, $5 per person for 16 or more people); minimum 12 week session required.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>PRIVATE YOGA CLASSES\r\n</strong>Maybe you don’t feel comfortable practicing in a group setting, would like the time-saving convenience of having yoga classes in your home or you wish to deepen your practice and knowledge. Our private yoga classes are a good choice for you. We will come to you* for one-on-one yoga classes or make it a social event and invite some friends and family members to join you. Our private classes are ideal for 1-6 people.\r\n\r\n*If you are interested in private yoga classes, but do not have the appropriate space, we can make arrangements for studio space. Additional fees may apply.\r\n\r\nWe offer the following:\r\n\r\n# of Sessions        Cost per class*: 60 mins        90 mins\r\n\r\nSingle class                                          $80                 $110\r\n8 or more weekly classes                  $75                 $105\r\n\r\n*Prices do not include HST.\r\n\r\n<strong>STUDIO GROUP CLASSES\r\n</strong>All of our teachers also teach at other studios throughout the local area. Here’s where you can catch a group class with our yoga teachers, experience other styles of yoga and support other local yoga studios:\r\n\r\n<strong>Chantelle Diachina </strong>(Classical Hatha Yoga; Vinyasa)\r\n<a href="http://downtownlondonyoga.ca/">Downtown Yoga Holistic Centre,</a> Fridays 12:00-1:00pm\r\n<a href="https://fcssc.ca/register/more/5">Forest City Sport &amp; Social Club (FCSSC)</a> Wednesdays evenings (time varies per session)\r\n\r\n<strong>Kim Ellig-Picken </strong>(Pre &amp; Post Natal Yoga; Interdisciplinary Hatha)<strong>\r\n</strong> <a href="http://mothernurture.ca/">MotherNurture Yoga</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Laura Johnson</strong> (Hot Yoga &amp; Vinyasa)\r\n<a href="http://www.karmayogastudio.ca/karmayogastudio/Home.html">Karma Yoga</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Gabrielle Rickman:</strong> (Power Yoga &amp; Interdisciplinary Hatha)\r\nBeBalanced Yoga', 'Yoga', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'yoga', '', '', '2013-11-10 00:47:39', '2013-11-10 00:47:39', '', 0, 'http://prana.gav.rtr/?page_id=11', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Her first yoga teacher was Kiran, who was from India and had been taught yoga as a child by her grandfather. What Chantelle thought was just another form of exercise, quickly became so much more.\r\nAs a survivor of domestic violence, Chantelle experienced first hand the incredible healing power yoga has on the mind, body and soul.

Not sure if she made the right choice, Chantelle continued to teach a few yoga classes, but returned to school a year later and received her certification in Public Relations and Communications from Fanshawe College. She was immediately hired upon graduation with digital agency, rtraction, as their client relations manager, but it only took a few years before the yoga called her back. From colleagues asking her for advice on personal life issues and ways to loosen tense muscles to being invited to speak about workplace wellness for a Regional Mental Health Care Lunch and Learn at St. Joeseph''s Hospital, Chantelle realized there was a high need for yoga and effective stress management in the workplace.

Her first yoga teacher was Kiran, who was from India and had been taught yoga as a child by her grandfather. What Chantelle thought was just another form of exercise, quickly became so much more.\r\nAs a survivor of domestic violence, Chantelle experienced first hand the incredible healing power yoga has on the mind, body and soul. She also noticed she was sick with colds and flu less often and was better prepared to face the stresses of day to day life.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a decade of being a classroom teacher, Chantelle left her career to pursue her passion for yoga. In 2007, she traveled to Miramar, Florida to study under Master Yogi Hari Sukhu of the Sivananda lineage and receive her 200-hour yoga teacher certification. Not sure if she made the right choice, Chantelle continued to teach a few yoga classes, but returned to school a year later and received her certification in Public Relations and Communications from Fanshawe College. She was immediately hired upon graduation with digital agency, rtraction, as their client relations manager, but it only took a few years before the yoga called her back. From colleagues asking her for advice on personal life issues and ways to loosen tense muscles to being invited to speak about workplace wellness for a Regional Mental Health Care Lunch and Learn at St. Joeseph''s Hospital, Chantelle realized there was a high need for yoga and effective stress management in the workplace. In January of 2013, Chantelle left rtraction and began to pour her heart and soul into creating Prana Yoga &amp; Wellness, which officially launched in October 2013.\r\n\r\nChantelle also offers classes through Forest City Sport &amp; Social Club, Downtown Yoga Holistic Centre and at her private home studio.', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-09 21:03:12', '2013-11-09 21:03:12', '', 2, 'http://prana.gav.rtr/2-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Not sure if she made the right choice, Chantelle continued to teach a few yoga classes, but returned to school a year later and received her certification in Public Relations and Communications from Fanshawe College. She was immediately hired upon graduation with digital agency, rtraction, as their client relations manager, but it only took a few years before the yoga called her back. From colleagues asking her for advice on personal life issues, how to loosen tense muscles to being requested to teach private group classes and speaking about workplace wellness for a Regional Mental Health Care Lunch and Learn at St. Joseph''s Hospital, Chantelle realized there was a high need for yoga and effective stress management in the workplace. In January of 2013, Chantelle left rtraction and began to pour her heart and soul into creating Prana Yoga &amp; Wellness, which officially launched in October 2013 and she hasn''t looked back since.

What Chantelle thought was just another form of exercise, quickly became so much more.\nAs a survivor of domestic violence, Chantelle experienced first hand the incredible healing power yoga has on the mind, body and soul.

In 2007, she traveled to Miramar, Florida to study under Master Yogi Hari Sukhu of the Sivananda lineage and receive her 200-hour yoga teacher certification. Not sure if she made the right choice, Chantelle continued to teach a few yoga classes and further her knowledge by attending workshops led by Seane Corn and Dharma Mittra.  returned to school a year later and received her certification in Public Relations and Communications from Fanshawe College. She was immediately hired upon graduation with digital agency, rtraction, as their client relations manager, but it only took a few years before yoga called her back. From colleagues asking her for yogic advice on personal life issues and how to loosen tense muscles to being requested to teach private group classes and speaking about workplace wellness for a Regional Mental Health Care Lunch and Learn at St. Joseph''s Hospital, Chantelle realized there was a high need for yoga and effective stress management in the workplace.
